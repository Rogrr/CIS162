    <h2> Hello ,  </h2>

    <p>  Im Roger Ramirez and this is my first semester at Cerritos College. I originally graduated from CSULB in 2014 with a Film degree and minor in Communication studies. After graudation I work alot in the lighting aspect of film/television and music industry. Working on projects like Superbowl LIV Miami, American Music Awards and more. However due to injury, burnout and the industry shut downs I have shifted into a teaching role at a local middle school as a full time substitute.  Over these past two years I have slowly been taking self taught programing courses and wish to one day work remote as a Software Engineer. This is my first official programing course and I'm excited to be here.
